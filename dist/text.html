              Think of it this way: There are two kinds of failure. The first
              comes from never trying out your ideas because you are afraid, or
              because you are waiting for the perfect time. This kind of failure
              you can never learn from, and such timidity will destroy you. The
              second kind comes from a bold and venturesome spirit.
            </p>
            <p class="recall__text">
              If you fail in this way, the hit that you take to your reputation
              is greatly outweighed by what you learn. Repeated failure will
              toughen your spirit and show you with absolute clarity how things
              must be done.

              In the future, the great division will be between those who have
              trained themselves to handle these complexities and those who are
              overwhelmed by them -- those who can acquire skills and discipline
              their minds and those who are irrevocably distracted by all the
              media around them and can enver focus enough to learn.

              We are all in search of feeling more connected to realityâ€”to other
              people, the times we live in, the natural world, our character,
              and our own uniqueness. Our culture increasingly tends to separate
              us from these realities in various ways.
            </p>
            <p class="recall__text">
              We indulge in drugs or alcohol, or engage in dangerous sports or
              risky behavior, just to wake ourselves up from the sleep of our
              daily existence and feel a heightened sense of connection to
              reality. In the end, however, the most satisfying and powerful way
              to feel this connection is through creative activity.
            </p>
            <p class="recall__text">
              Engaged in the creative process we feel more alive than ever,
              because we are making something and not merely consuming, Masters
              of the small reality we create. In doing this work, we are in fact
              creating ourselves.
